# Custom-Variables-Unity-Package

This is a factory to create wrappers around variables in the form of scriptable objects.
These scriptable objects can be saved in assets and referenced by objects in or out of scenes.
Therefore monobehaviors will not depend on each other for values, only the scriptable objects in the asset folder.
